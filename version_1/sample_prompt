Lately I’ve been feeling like I’m trapped in this endless loop where I oscillate between extreme motivation and complete apathy. I’ll have days where I feel almost euphoric, like I could achieve anything, but then I spiral into these nights of self-loathing and existential dread, questioning whether any of my accomplishments actually matter. I notice intrusive thoughts about past mistakes, fear of future failure, and at times a haunting sense that I’m living someone else’s life. I try to meditate, journal, and exercise, but it feels like temporary patches rather than a solution. I also feel guilty for burdening my friends and family with these thoughts, yet I crave validation and understanding. Sometimes I wonder if I’m depressed, anxious, or just inherently flawed. I don’t know how to reconcile these extremes in myself, and it’s exhausting trying to maintain the illusion of being ‘okay.’ I’ve also noticed that these feelings tend to worsen in social settings where I feel scrutinized, and I sometimes isolate myself preemptively to avoid perceived judgment. How can I understand what’s happening in my mind without spiraling further into self-criticism?
